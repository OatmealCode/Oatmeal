## What is Carlos?

`Carlos` is a set of classes and functions that gives you many LEGOâ„¢-like building blocks based on the [Composite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern) and [Decorator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern) design patterns to create and customize your cache infrastructure.
You start with a simple cache level or with one of the caches that `Carlos` provides you out-of-the-box, and then start applying its functions to build a tree structure of cache levels. The resulting root of the tree is a cache level itself, so you will be able to use it right away in your app.

For more information on how to use `Carlos`, please consult its complete [README](https://github.com/WeltN24/Carlos/blob/master/Carlos/README.md).

`Carlos` now also ships with a small set of functions that make it easier to write asynchronous code through the use of `Future`s and `Promise`s. The child framework is called `Pied Piper` and you can reda more about it [here](https://github.com/WeltN24/Carlos/blob/master/Futures/README.md).

## Installation

Information on how to integrate `Carlos` or `Pied Piper` in your project are available respectively [here](https://github.com/WeltN24/Carlos/blob/master/Carlos/README.md#installation) and [here](https://github.com/WeltN24/Carlos/blob/master/Futures/README.md#installation).

## Playground

`Carlos` and `Pied Piper` ship with 2 playgrounds for you to get to know the frameworks better. 
You can find more information on how to use the playground respectively [here](https://github.com/WeltN24/Carlos/blob/master/Carlos/README.md#playground) and [here](https://github.com/WeltN24/Carlos/blob/master/Futures/README.md#playground).

## Requirements

- iOS 8.0+
- WatchOS 2+
- Mac OS X 10.9+
- Xcode 7+
- tvOS 9+

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo. You'll find sample schemes for `iOS`, `watchOS`, `Mac OS` and `tvOS`.

For detailed information about what it's possible to do with `Carlos` and `Pied Piper` please respectively have a look [here](https://github.com/WeltN24/Carlos/blob/master/Carlos/README.md#usage) and [here](https://github.com/WeltN24/Carlos/blob/master/Futures/README.md#usage).

## Tests

`Carlos` and `Pied Piper` are thouroughly tested so that the features they are designed to provide are safe for refactoring and as much as possible bug-free. 

We use [Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick) and [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble) instead of `XCTest` in order to have a good BDD test layout, and have more than **2000 tests** covering the codebase at the moment.

## Future development

`Carlos` and `Pied Piper` are under development and [here](https://github.com/WeltN24/Carlos/issues) you can see all the open issues. They are assigned to milestones so that you can have an idea of when a given feature will be shipped.

If you want to contribute to this repo, please:

- Create an issue explaining your problem and your solution
- Clone the repo on your local machine
- Create a branch with the issue number and a short abstract of the feature name
- Implement your solution
- Write tests (untested features won't be merged)
- When all the tests are written and green, create a pull request, with a short description of the approach taken

## Acknowledgements

`Carlos` internally uses:

- **Crypto** (available on [Github](https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/CryptoSwift)), slightly adapted to compile with Swift 2.0.
- **ConcurrentOperation** (by [Caleb Davenport](https://github.com/calebd)), unmodified.

The **DiskCacheLevel** class is inspired by [Haneke](https://github.com/Haneke/HanekeSwift). The source code has been heavily modified, but adapting the original file has proven valuable for `Carlos` development.

`Pied Piper` internally uses:

- Some parts of `ReadWriteLock.swift` (in particular the pthread-based read-write lock) belonging to **Deferred** (available on [Github](https://github.com/bignerdranch/Deferred))
