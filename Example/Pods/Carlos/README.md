## What is Carlos?

`Carlos` is a small set of classes, functions and convenience operators to **realize custom, flexible and powerful cache layers** in your application.

By default, **`Carlos` ships with an in-memory cache, a disk cache, a simple network fetcher and a `NSUserDefaults` cache** (the disk cache is inspired by [HanekeSwift](https://github.com/Haneke/HanekeSwift)). 

With `Carlos` you can:

- **create levels and fetchers** depending on your needs, either [through classes](#creating-custom-levels) or with [simple closures](#composing-with-closures)
- [combine levels](#usage-examples)
- [transform the key](#key-transformations) each level will get, [or the values](#value-transformations) each level will output (this means you're free to implement every level independing on how it will be used later on). Some common value transformers are already provided with `Carlos`
- Apply [post-processing steps](#post-processing-output) to a cache level, for example sanitizing the output or resizing images
- [react to memory pressure events](#listening-to-memory-warnings) in your app
- **automatically populate upper levels when one of the lower levels fetches a value** for a key, so the next time the first level will already have it cached
- enable or disable specific levels of your composed cache depending on [boolean conditions](#conditioning-caches)
- easily [**pool requests**](#pooling-requests) so you don't have to care whether 5 requests with the same key have to be executed by an expensive cache level before even only 1 of them is done. `Carlos` can take care of that for you
- setup [multiple lanes](#multiple-cache-lanes) for complex scenarios where, depending on certain keys or conditions, different caches should be used
- [Cap the number of concurrent requests](#limiting-concurrent-requests) a cache should handle
- [Dispatch](#dispatching-caches) all the operations of your cache on a specific GCD queue
- have a type-safe complex cache that won't even compile if the code doesn't satisfy the type requirements 


## Installation

### CocoaPods

`Carlos` is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```
pod "Carlos"
```

### Submodule

If you don't use CocoaPods, you can still add `Carlos` as a submodule, drag and drop `Carlos.xcodeproj` into your project, and embed `Carlos.framework` in your target.

- Drag `Carlos.xcodeproj` to your project
- Select your app target
- Click the `+` button on the `Embedded binaries` section
- Add `Carlos.framework` (for `WatchOS 2` apps, use `CarlosWatch.framework`; for `Mac OS X` apps, use `CarlosMac.framework`; for `tvOS` apps, use `CarlosTv.framework`)

### Carthage

`Carthage` is also supported.

### Manual

You can directly drag and drop the needed files into your project, but keep in mind that this way you won't be able to automatically get all the latest `Carlos` features (e.g. new files including new operations).

The files are contained in the `Carlos` folder and work for both the `iOS` and `tvOS` frameworks.

If you want to integrate `Carlos` in a WatchOS 2 app, please don't include the file `MemoryWarning.swift`.

If you want to integrate `Carlos` in a Mac OS X app, please don't include the files `MemoryWarning.swift` and all the files with the `+iOS` suffix. Additionally, please include the files with the `+Mac` suffix.

## Playground

We ship a small Xcode Playground with the project, so you can quickly see how `Carlos` works and experiment with your custom layers, layers combinations and different configurations for requests pooling, capping, etc.

To use our Playground, please follow these steps:

- Open the Xcode project `Carlos.xcodeproj`
- Select the `Carlos` framework target, and a **64-bit platform** (e.g. `iPhone 6`)
- Build the target with `âŒ˜+B`
- Click the Playground file `Carlos.playground`
- Write your code

## Requirements

- iOS 8.0+
- WatchOS 2+
- Mac OS X 10.9+
- Xcode 7+
- tvOS 9+

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo.

### Usage examples

```swift
let cache = MemoryCacheLevel<String, NSData>() >>> DiskCacheLevel()
```

This line will generate a cache that takes `String` keys and returns `NSData` values.
Setting a value for a given key on this cache will set it for both the levels.
Getting a value for a given key on this cache will first try getting it on the memory level, and if it cannot find one, will ask the disk level. 
In case both levels don't have a value, the request will fail.
In case the disk level can fetch a value, this will also be set on the memory level so that the next fetch will be faster.

`Carlos` comes with a `CacheProvider` class so that standard caches are easily accessible. Starting from version `0.2.0`, `CacheProvider` has 2 static functions:

- `CacheProvider.dataCache()` to create a cache that takes `NSURL` keys and returns `NSData` values
- `CacheProvider.imageCache()` to create a cache that takes `NSURL` keys and returns `UIImage` values

The method `CacheProvider.imageCache()` is not available yet for the `CarlosMac.framework` framework.

Starting from version `0.4.0`, `CacheProvider` also offers the new function:

- `CacheProvider.JSONCache()` to create a cache that takes `NSURL` keys and returns `AnyObject` values (that should be then safely casted to arrays or dictionaries depending on your application)

### Creating requests

To fetch a value from a cache, use the `get` method.

```swift
cache.get("key")
  .onSuccess { value in
      print("I found \(value)!")
  }
  .onFailure { error in
      print("An error occurred :( \(error)")
  }
```

You can also store the request somewhere and then attach multiple `onSuccess` or `onFailure` listeners to it:

```swift
let request = cache.get("key")

request.onSuccess { value in
    print("I found \(value)!")
}

[... somewhere else]


request.onSuccess { value in
    print("I can read \(value), too!")
}

```

A request can also be canceled with the `cancel()` method, and you can be notified of this event by calling `onCancel` on a given request:

```swift
let request = cache.get(key).onCancel {
	print(""Looks like somebody canceled this request!")
}

[... somewhere else]
request.cancel()
```

**When the cache request succeeds, all its listeners are called**. And **even if you add a listener after the request already did its job, you will still get the callback**.
**A request is in only one state between *executing*, *succeeded*, *failed* or *canceled* at any given time**, and **cannot fail, succeed or be canceled more than once**.

If you are just interested in when the request completes, regardless of whether it succeeded, failed or was canceled, you can use `onCompletion`:

```swift
request.onCompletion { (value, error) in
   if let value = value {
       print("Request succeeded with value \(value)")
   } else if let error = error {
       print("Request failed with code \(error)")
   } else {
   	   print("This request has been canceled")
   }
   
   print("Nevertheless the request completed")
}
```

This cache is not very useful, though. It will never *actively* fetch values, just store them for later use. Let's try to make it more interesting:

```swift
let cache = MemoryCacheLevel() >>> DiskCacheLevel() >>> NetworkFetcher()
```

This will create a cache level that takes `NSURL` keys and stores `NSData` values (the type is inferred from the `NetworkFetcher` hard-requirement of `NSURL` keys and `NSData` values, while `MemoryCacheLevel` and `DiskCacheLevel` are much more flexible as described later).

### Key transformations

Key transformations are meant to make it possible to plug cache levels in whatever cache you're building.

Let's see how they work:

```swift    
// Define your custom ErrorType values
enum URLTransformationError: ErrorType {
    case InvalidURLString
}

let transformedCache = { Promise(value: NSURL(string: $0), error: URLTransformationError.InvalidURLString).future } =>> NetworkFetcher()
``` 

With the line above, we're saying that all the keys coming into the NetworkFetcher level have to be transformed to `NSURL` values first. We can now plug this cache into a previously defined cache level that takes `String` keys:

```swift
let cache = MemoryCacheLevel<String, NSData>() >>> transformedCache
```

or 

```swift
let cache = MemoryCacheLevel<String, NSData>() >>> ({ Promise(value: NSURL(string: $0), error: URLTransformationError.InvalidURLString).future } =>> NetworkFetcher())
```

If this doesn't look very safe (one could always pass string garbage as a key and it won't magically translate to a `NSURL`, thus causing the `NetworkFetcher` to silently fail), we can still use a domain specific structure as a key, assuming it contains both `String` and `NSURL` values:

```swift
struct Image {
  let identifier: String
  let URL: NSURL
}

let imageToString = OneWayTransformationBox(transform: { (image: Image) -> Future<String> in
    Promise(value: image.identifier).future
})
    
let imageToURL = OneWayTransformationBox(transform: { (image: Image) -> Future<NSURL> in
    Promise(value: image.URL).future
})
    
let memoryLevel = imageToString =>> MemoryCacheLevel<String, NSData>()
let diskLevel = imageToString =>> DiskCacheLevel<String, NSData>()
let networkLevel = imageToURL =>> NetworkFetcher()
    
let cache = memoryLevel >>> diskLevel >>> networkLevel
```

*All the transformer objects could be replaced with closures* as we did in the previous example, and the whole cache could be created in one line, if needed.

Now we can perform safe requests like this:

```swift
let image = Image(identifier: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000", URL: NSURL(string: "http://goo.gl/KcGz8T")!)

cache.get(image).onSuccess { value in
  print("Found \(value)!")
}
```

Since `Carlos 0.5` you can also apply conditions to `OneWayTransformers` used for key transformations. Just call the `conditioned` function on the transformer and pass your condition. The condition can also be asynchronous and has to return a `Future<Bool>`, having the chance to return a specific error for the failure of the transformation.

```swift
let transformer = OneWayTransformationBox<String, NSURL>(transform: { key in
  Promise(value: NSURL(string: key), error: MyError.StringIsNotURL).future
}).conditioned { key in
  Promise(value: key.rangeOfString("http") != nil).future
}

let cache = transformer =>> CacheProvider.imageCache()
```

That's not all, though.

What if our disk cache only stores `NSData`, but we want our memory cache to conveniently store `UIImage` instances instead? 

### Value transformations

Value transformers let you have a cache that (let's say) stores `NSData` and mutate it to a cache that stores `UIImage` values. Let's see how:

```swift
let dataTransformer = TwoWayTransformationBox(transform: { (image: UIImage) -> Future<NSData> in
    Promise(value: UIImagePNGRepresentation(image)).future
}, inverseTransform: { (data: NSData) -> Future<UIImage> in
    Promise(value: UIImage(data: data)!).future
})
    
let memoryLevel = imageToString =>> MemoryCacheLevel<String, UIImage>() =>> dataTransformer
    
``` 

This memory level can now replace the one we had before, with the difference that it will internally store `UIImage` values!

Keep in mind that, as with key transformations, if your transformation closure fails (either the forward transformation or the inverse transformation), the cache level will be skipped, as if the fetch would fail. Same considerations apply for `set` calls.

`Carlos` comes with some value transformers out of the box, for example:

- `JSONTransformer` to serialize `NSData` instances into JSON
- `ImageTransformer` to serialize `NSData` instances into `UIImage` values (not available on the Mac OS X framework)
- `StringTransformer` to serialize `NSData` instances into `String` values with a given encoding
- Extensions for some Cocoa classes (`NSDateFormatter`, `NSNumberFormatter`, `MKDistanceFormatter`) so that you can use customized instances depending on your needs (these are not available for the `tvOS` version of `Carlos`)

As of `Carlos 0.4`, it's possible to transform values coming out of `Fetcher` instances with just a `OneWayTransformer` (as opposed to the required `TwoWayTransformer` for normal `CacheLevel` instancess. This is because the `Fetcher` protocol doesn't require `set`).
This means you can easily chain `Fetcher` (closures as well) that get a JSON from the internet and transform their output to a model object (for example a `struct`) into a complex cache pipeline without having to create a dummy inverse transformation just to satisfy the requirements of the `TwoWayTransformer` protocol.

As of `Carlos 0.5`, all transformers natively support asynchronous computation, so you can have expensive transformations in your custom transformers without blocking other operations. In fact, the `ImageTransformer` that comes out of the box processes image transformations on a background queue.

As of `Carlos 0.5` you can also apply conditions to `TwoWayTransformers` used for value transformations. Just call the `conditioned` function on the transformer and pass your conditions (one for the forward transformation, one for the inverse transformation). The conditions can also be asynchronous and have to return a `Future<Bool>`, having the chance to return a specific error for the failure of the transformation.

```swift
let transformer = JSONTransformer().conditioned({ input in
  Promise(value: myCondition).future
}, inverseCondition: { input in
  Promise(value: myCondition).future
})

let cache = CacheProvider.dataCache() =>> transformer
```

### Post-processing output

In some cases your cache level could return the right value, but in a sub-optimal format. For example, you would like to sanitize the output you're getting from the Cache as a whole, independently of the exact layer that returned it.

For these cases, the `postProcess` function introduced with `Carlos 0.4` could come helpful.
The function is available as a protocol extension of the `CacheLevel` protocol, as a global function and as an operator in the form of `~>>`.

The `postProcess` function takes a `CacheLevel` (or a fetch closure) and a `OneWayTransformer` (or a transformation closure) with `TypeIn == TypeOut` as parameters and outputs a decorated `BasicCache` with the post-processing step embedded in.

```swift
// Let's create a simple "to uppercase" transformer
let transformer = OneWayTransformationBox<NSString, NSString>(transform: { Promise(value: $0.uppercaseString).future }) 

// Our memory cache
let memoryCache = MemoryCacheLevel<String, NSString>()

// Our decorated cache
let transformedCache = memoryCache.postProcess(transformer)

// Lowercase value set on the memory layer
memoryCache.set("test String", forKey: "key")

// We get the lowercase value from the undecorated memory layer 
memoryCache.get("key").onSuccess { value in
  let x = value
}

// We get the uppercase value from the decorated cache, though
transformedCache.get("key").onSuccess { value in
  let x = value
}
```

Since `Carlos 0.5` you can also apply conditions to `OneWayTransformers` used for post processing transformations. Just call the `conditioned` function on the transformer and pass your condition. The condition can also be asynchronous and has to return a `Future<Bool>`, having the chance to return a specific error for the failure of the transformation. Keep in mind that the condition will actually take the output of the cache as the input, not the key used to fetch this value! 

```swift
let processer = OneWayTransformationBox<NSData, NSData>(transform: { value in
  Promise(value: NSString(data: value, encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding)?.uppercaseString.dataUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding), error: MyError.DataCannotBeDecoded).future
}).conditioned { value in
  Promise(value: value.length < 1000).future
}

let cache = CacheProvider.dataCache() ~>> processer
```

### Composing transformers

As of `Carlos 0.4`, it's possible to compose multiple `OneWayTransformer` objects. 
This way, one can create several transformer modules to build a small library and then combine them as more convenient depending on the application.

You can compose the transformers in the same way you do with normal `CacheLevel`s: with the `compose` function, with the `compose` protocol extension or with the `>>>` operator:

```swift
let firstTransformer = ImageTransformer() // NSData -> UIImage
let secondTransformer = ImageTransformer().invert() // Trivial UIImage -> NSData

let identityTransformer = firstTransformer >>> secondTransformer
```

The same approach can be applied to `TwoWayTransformer` objects (that by the way are already `OneWayTransformer` as well).

Many transformer modules will be provided by default with `Carlos`.

### Pooling requests

When you have a working cache, but some of your levels are expensive (say a Network fetcher or a database fetcher), **you may want to pool requests in a way that multiple requests for the same key, coming together before one of them completes, are grouped so that when one completes all of the other complete as well without having to actually perform the expensive operation multiple times**.

This functionality comes with `Carlos`.

```swift
let cache = pooled(memoryLevel >>> diskLevel >>> networkLevel)
```

or, using protocol extensions:

```swift
let cache = (memoryLevel >>> diskLevel >>> networkLevel).pooled()
```

Keep in mind that the key must conform to the `Hashable` protocol for the `pooled` function to work:


```swift
extension Image: Hashable {
  var hashValue: Int {
    return identifier.hashValue
  }
}

extension Image: Equatable {
  
}

func ==(lhs: Image, rhs: Image) -> Bool {
  return lhs.identifier == rhs.identifier && lhs.URL == rhs.URL
}
```

Now we can execute multiple fetches for the same `Image` value and be sure that only one network request will be started.

### Limiting concurrent requests

If you want to limit the number of concurrent requests a cache level can take, independently of the key (otherwise, see the [pooling requests](#pooling-requests) paragraph), you may want to have a look at the `capRequests` function.

This is how it looks in practice:

```swift
let myCache = MyFirstLevel() >>> MySecondLevel()

let cappedCache = capRequests(myCache, 3)
```

or, with protocol extensions:

```swift
let cappedCache = myCache.capRequests(3)
```

`cappedCache` will now only accept a maximum of `3` concurrent `get` operations. If a fourth request comes, it will be enqueued and executed only at a later point when one of the executing requests is done. This may be useful when a resource is only accessible by a limited number of consumers at the same time, and creating another connection to the resource could be expensive or decrease the performance of the already executing requests.


### Conditioning caches 

Sometimes we may have levels that should only be queried under some conditions. Let's say we have a `DatabaseLevel` that should only be triggered when users enable a given setting in the app that actually starts storing data in the database. We may want to avoid accessing the database if the setting is disabled in the first place.

```swift
let conditionedCache = conditioned(cache) { key in
  Promise(value: appSettingIsEnabled).future
}
```

or, with protocol extensions:

```swift
let conditionedCache = cache.conditioned { key in
  Promise(value: appSettingIsEnabled).future
}
```

The closure gets the key the cache was asked to fetch and has to return a `Future<Bool>` object indicating whether the request can proceed or should skip the level, with the possibility to fail with a specific `ErrorType` to communicate the error to the caller.

The same effect can be obtained through the `<?>` operator:

```swift
let conditionedCache = { _ in
  Promise(value: appSettingIsEnabled).future
} <?> cache
```

At runtime, if the variable `appSettingIsEnabled` is `false`, the `get` request will skip the level (or fail if this was the only or last level in the cache). If `true`, the `get` request will be executed. 

### Dispatching caches

Since the `Carlos 0.5` release it's possible to dispatch all the operations of a given `CacheLevel` or fetch closure on a specific GCD queue through the `~>>` operator or the `dispatch` protocol extension.

```swift
let queue = dispatch_queue_create("com.vendor.customQueue", DISPATCH_QUEUE_CONCURRENT)

let cache = CacheProvider.imageCache().dispatch(queue)

[or]

let cache = CacheProvider.imageCache() ~>> queue
```

The resulting `CacheLevel` will dispatch `get`, `set`, `onMemoryWarning` and `clear` operations on the specified queue.

### Multiple cache lanes

If you have a complex scenario where, depending on the key or some other external condition, either one or another cache should be used, then the `switchLevels` function could turn useful.

Usage:

```swift
let lane1 = MemoryCacheLevel<NSURL, NSData>() // The two lanes have to be equivalent (same key type, same value type).
let lane2 = CacheProvider.dataCache() // Keep in mind that you can always use key transformation or value transformations if two lanes don't match by default

let switched = switchLevels(lane1, lane2) { key in
  if key.scheme == "http" {
  	return .CacheA
  } else {
   	return .CacheB // The example is just meant to show how to return different lanes
  }
}
```

Now depending on the scheme of the key URL, either the first lane or the second will be used.

### Listening to memory warnings

If we store big objects in memory in our cache levels, we may want to be notified of memory warning events. This is where the `listenToMemoryWarnings` and `unsubscribeToMemoryWarnings` functions come handy:

```swift
let token = cache.listenToMemoryWarnings()
```

and later

```swift
unsubscribeToMemoryWarnings(token)
```

With the first call, the cache level and all its composing levels will get a call to `onMemoryWarning` when a memory warning comes.

With the second call, the behavior will stop.

Keep in mind that this functionality is not yet supported by the WatchOS 2 framework `CarlosWatch.framework` and by the Mac OS X framework `CarlosMac.framework` framework neither.

### Normalization

In case you need to store the result of multiple `Carlos` composition calls in a property, it may be troublesome to set the type of the property to `BasicCache` as some calls return different types (e.g. `PoolCache`, `RequestCapperCache`). In this case, you can `normalize` the cache level before assigning it to the property and it will be converted to a `BasicCache` value.

```swift
import Carlos

class CacheManager {
  let cache: BasicCache<NSURL, NSData>
  
  init(injectedCache: BasicCache<NSURL, NSData>) {
	self.cache = injectedCache
  }
}

[...]

let manager = CacheManager(injectedCache: CacheProvider.dataCache().pooled().capRequests(3)) // This won't compile

let manager = CacheManager(injectedCache: CacheProvider.dataCache().pooled().capRequests(3).normalize()) // This will
```

As a tip, always use `normalize` if you need to assign the result of multiple composition calls to a property. The call is a no-op if the value is already a `BasicCache`, so there will be no performance loss in that case.

### Creating custom levels

Creating custom levels is easy and encouraged (after all, there are multiple cache libraries already available if you only need memory, disk and network functionalities!).

Let's see how to do it:

```swift
class MyLevel: CacheLevel {
  typealias KeyType = Int
  typealias OutputType = Float
  
  func get(key: KeyType) -> Future<OutputType> {
    let request = Promise<OutputType>()
    
    // Perform the fetch and either succeed or fail
    [...]
    
    request.succeed(1.0)
    
    return request.future
  }
  
  func set(value: OutputType, forKey key: KeyType) {
    // Store the value (db, memory, file, etc)
  }
  
  func clear() {
    // Clear the stored values
  }
  
  func onMemoryWarning() {
    // A memory warning event came. React appropriately
  }
}
```

The above class conforms to the `CacheLevel` protocol (used by all the functions and operators). 

First thing we need is to declare what key types we accept and what output types we return. In this example case, we have `Int` keys and `Float` output values.

The required methods to implement are 4: `get`, `set`, `clear` and `onMemoryWarning`.

`get` has to return a `Future`, we can create a `Promise` in the beginning of the method body and return its associated `Future` by calling `future` on it. Then we inform the listeners by calling `succeed` or `fail` on it depending on the outcome of the fetch. These calls can (and most of the times will) be asynchronous.

`set` has to store the given value for the given key.

`clear` expresses the intent to wipe the cache level.

`onMemoryWarning` notifies a memory pressure event in case the `listenToMemoryWarning` method was called before.

This sample cache can now be pipelined to a list of other caches, transforming its keys or values if needed as we saw in the earlier paragraphs.

You can create a `Promise` in several ways:
- as shown in the snippet above, that is by instantiating one and calling `succeed` or `fail` depending on the result of the operation;
- by directly returning the result of the initialization, passing either a value, an error, or both (if the value is optional):

Remember to call `future` on your `Promise` in the `return` statement!


```swift
//#1
let result: Promise<String>()

[...]

result.succeed("success")

// or

result.fail(Error.InvalidData)

return result.future
```

```swift
//#2
return Promise<String>(value: "success").future

//#3
return Promise<String>(error: Error.InvalidData).future

//#4
return Promise<String>(value: optionalString, error: Error.InvalidData).future
```

### Creating custom fetchers

With `Carlos 0.4`, the `Fetcher` protocol was introduced to make it easier for users of the library to create custom fetchers that can be used as read-only levels in the cache. An example of a "`Fetcher` in disguise" that has always been included in `Carlos` is `NetworkFetcher`: you can only use it to read from the network, not to write (`set`, `clear` and `onMemoryWarning` were **no-ops**).

This is how easy it is now to implement your custom fetcher:

```swift
class CustomFetcher: Fetcher {
  typealias KeyType = String
  typealias OutputType = String
  
  func get(key: KeyType) -> Future<OutputType> {
    return Promise(value: "Found an hardcoded value :)").future
  }
}
```

You still need to declare what `KeyType` and `OutputType` your `CacheLevel` deals with, of course, but then you're only required to implement `get`. Less boilerplate for you!

### Composing with closures

Sometimes we could have simple fetchers that don't need `set`, `clear` and `onMemoryWarning` implementations because they don't store anything. In this case we can pipeline fetch closures instead of full-blown caches.

```swift
let fetcherLevel = { (image: Image) -> Future<NSData> in
    let request = Promise<NSData>()
      
    request.succeed(NSData(contentsOfURL: image.URL)!)
      
    return request.future
}
    
```

This fetcher can be plugged in and replace the `NetworkFetcher` for example:

```swift
let cache = pooled(memoryLevel >>> diskLevel >>> fetcherLevel)
```

### Built-in levels

`Carlos` comes with 3 cache levels out of the box:

- `MemoryCacheLevel`
- `DiskCacheLevel`
- `NetworkFetcher`
- Since the `0.5` release, a `NSUserDefaultsCacheLevel`

**MemoryCacheLevel** is a volatile cache that internally stores its values in an `NSCache` instance. The capacity can be specified through the initializer, and it supports clearing under memory pressure (if the level is [subscribed to memory warning notifications](#listening-to-memory-warnings)). 
It accepts keys of any given type that conforms to the `StringConvertible` protocol and can store values of any given type that conforms to the `ExpensiveObject` protocol. `NSData`, `String`, `NSString` `UIImage`, `NSURL` already conform to the latter protocol out of the box, while `String`, `NSString` and `NSURL` conform to the `StringConvertible` protocol. 
This cache level is thread-safe.

**DiskCacheLevel** is a persistent cache that asynchronously stores its values on disk. The capacity can be specified through the initializer, so that the disk size will never get too big.
It accepts keys of any given type that conforms to the `StringConvertible` protocol and can store values of any given type that conforms to the `NSCoding` protocol.
This cache level is thread-safe.

**NetworkFetcher** is a cache level that asynchronously fetches values over the network. 
It accepts `NSURL` keys and returns `NSData` values.
This cache level is thread-safe.

**NSUserDefaultsCacheLevel** is a persistent cache that stores its values on a `NSUserDefaults` persistent domain with a specific name.
It accepts keys of any given type that conforms to the `StringConvertible` protocol and can store values of any given type that conforms to the `NSCoding` protocol.
It has an internal soft cache used to avoid hitting the persistent storage too often, and can be cleared without affecting other values saved on the `standardUserDefaults` or on other persistent domains.
This cache level is thread-safe.

## Tests

`Carlos` is thouroughly tested so that the features it's designed to provide are safe for refactoring and as much as possible bug-free. 

We use [Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick) and [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble) instead of `XCTest` in order to have a good BDD test layout.

As of today, there are more than **1400 tests** for `Carlos` (see the folder `Tests`), and overall the tests codebase is *double the size* of the production codebase.

## Future development

`Carlos` is under development and [here](https://github.com/WeltN24/Carlos/issues) you can see all the open issues. They are assigned to milestones so that you can have an idea of when a given feature will be shipped.

If you want to contribute to this repo, please:

- Create an issue explaining your problem and your solution
- Clone the repo on your local machine
- Create a branch with the issue number and a short abstract of the feature name
- Implement your solution
- Write tests (untested features won't be merged)
- When all the tests are written and green, create a pull request, with a short description of the approach taken

## Acknowledgements

`Carlos` internally uses:

- **Crypto** (available on [Github](https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/CryptoSwift)), slightly adapted to compile with Swift 2.0.
- **ConcurrentOperation** (by [Caleb Davenport](https://github.com/calebd)), unmodified.
- Some parts of `ReadWriteLock.swift` (in particular the pthread-based read-write lock) belonging to **Deferred** (available on [Github](https://github.com/bignerdranch/Deferred))

The **DiskCacheLevel** class is inspired by [Haneke](https://github.com/Haneke/HanekeSwift). The source code has been heavily modified, but adapting the original file has proven valuable for `Carlos` development.
